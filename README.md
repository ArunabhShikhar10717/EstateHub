This is a full-featured real estate web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with Tailwind CSS for styling. The project includes secure user authentication (email/password and Google OAuth), protected routes using JWT and Redux Toolkit, persistent state with Redux Persist, image uploading via Cloudinary or Firebase, and listing creation with dynamic search filtering. Deployed on Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend), it provides a complete production-ready experience for creating, searching, and managing real estate listings.
